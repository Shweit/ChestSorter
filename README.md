## Overview
The ChestSort Plugin provides an intuitive way to sort both container inventories (chests, shulker boxes, etc.) and player inventories on your Minecraft server. With this plugin, players can organize their items by type, amount, category, or even shuffle them randomly, all through simple commands.

## Features
- **Sorting by Amount:** Organizes items in a container based on their total stack size, placing larger stacks first.
- **Sorting Alphabetically:** Sorts items in the container based on their names.
- **Sorting by Category:** Groups items based on their Minecraft creative categories.
- **Random Shuffle:** Randomly shuffles all items in the container.

## Commands
`/sort <player/coordinates> [sortType]`
- **Description:** Sorts the items in the specified container or player's inventory based on the specified criteria.
- **Permission:** permission.node
- **Example:** 
  - `/sort` -> Sorts the Player's inventory alphabetically.
  - `/sort Shweit amount` -> Sorts the Player's inventory by amount.
  - `/sort 0 0 0 category` -> Sorts the container at coordinates (0, 0, 0) by category.
